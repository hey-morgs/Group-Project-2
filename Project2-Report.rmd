## Background
The Global Health Initiative has recently employed a new data science response team, CSIT-165, that uses data science to characterize pandemic diseases. CSIT-165 disseminates data driven analyses to global and local decision makers.

CSIT-165 is a conglomerate comprised of two fabricated entities: World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. Pandemic Response Team (USPRT). 

Morgan is part of the WHO
Preena is part of the USPRT
